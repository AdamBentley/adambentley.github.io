##About 20s ago I hit record

My camera is standing 6ft from me perched on the window sill of my basement office — and I can feel its blinking red eye.

Scary and cool.

Cool because this isn’t any spur of the moment shooting. It’s because for the last 2 months I have fantasised about making videos. 

What’s so cool about a video of me writing? It is my first video.

You might have gotten into the same situation that I have. Overthinking an underdoing.

But here’s the thing:

It almost never pays to wait too long to do it.

You can dream and pre-plan until all those ducks are in a row. 

But like Seth Godin will ask _‘what you gonna do with that duck?’_

The answer? 

Probably nothing. 

I’ve come to realise that thinking about something for too long makes it less likely you’ll go through with it. Sometimes you just have to do it.

There are hidden messaeges all over the place that can teach you this lesson, but somehow they just don’t shout loud enough to drown your inner voice.

The sayings go:

Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry (I think I butchered that one)

And the risks of overthinking and undergoing are seeable in the social science literature too. 

Just one instance: telling people your goals reduces the chances of you actually succeeding in them. 

So instead of taking time to process and predict. Just press go.

I think it really has something to do with you widening the gap between expectation and reality. Dreaming up the perfect scenario, contingencies and all is great until you realise one fact.

(1) It’s never going to happen that way. (2) It’s harder to execute than you thought. And (3) that perfectly abstract plan lacks the detail of how to move from here to there. 

But, I don’ think the solution is that complex. 

When you look at them, highly productive doers seem like a different species from you and I, e.g. the thinkers. Casey Neistat is just one example, but he’s putting out a 10 to 12 min vlog every day. Not any vlog, a highly produced expertly edited vlog. And that’s alongside his daddy duties, running a tech company, travelling, and creating advertising movies for companies. 

He get’s a shit ton done. 

But I think the solution is as simple as making the smallest step forward as quickly as possible. Not easy, but a habit that I think can be cultivated.

There’s two reasons. That I can think of right now. 

Nothing feels as real as taking action. It’s the difference between living in your head and living in your hands. I can’t explain it. You just have to feel it.
The more you live in your head and don’t actually produce something tangible, the more you’ll feel like you can’t change the world. 

And that my friends is a sorry and tragic place to live.
